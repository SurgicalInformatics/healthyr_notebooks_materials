In this session we will get to know our three best friends for summarising data: `group_by()`, `summarise()`, and `mutate()`.


# Data

In Session 2, we used a very condensed version of the Global Burden of Disease data. In this module we are going back to a longer one and we will learn how to summarise it ourselves.

```{r, message=F}
source(here::here("healthyr_theme.R"))
load(here::here("global_burden_disease_long.rda"))
```

We were already using this longer dataset in Session 1, but with `colour=cause` to hide the fact that the total deaths in each year was made up of 12 groups of data (as the black lines on the bars indicate):

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
mydata %>% 
	ggplot(aes(x=year, y=deaths_millions, fill=cause))+ 
	geom_col(colour = "black")

mydata %>% 
	filter(year == 1990)
```


# Tidyverse packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, etc.

Most of the functions introduced in this session come from the tidyverse family (http://tidyverse.org/), rather than Base R. Including `library(tidyverse)` in your script loads a list of packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, forcats, etc.

![](library_vs_package.png)


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


# Basic functions for summarising data

You can always pick a column and ask R to give you the `sum()`, `mean()`, `min()`, `max()`, etc. for it:

```{r}
mydata$deaths_millions %>% sum()
mydata$deaths_millions %>% mean()
```

But if you want to get the total number of deaths for each `year` (or `cause`, or `sex`, whichever grouping variables you have in your dataset) you can use `group_by()` and `summarise()` that make subgroup analysis very convenient and efficient.


# Subgroup analysis: `group_by()` and `summarise()`

The `group_by()` function tells R that you are about to perform subgroup analysis on your data. It retains information about your groupings and calculations are applied on each group separately. To go back to summarising the whole dataset again use `ungroup()`. Note that `summarise()` is different to the `summary()` function we used in Session 2.

With `summarise()`, we can calculate the total number of deaths per year:

```{r}
summary_data1 = 
  mydata %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(total_per_year = sum(deaths_millions))
summary_data1

summary_data2 = 
  mydata %>% 
  group_by(year, cause) %>% 
  summarise(total_per_cause = sum(deaths_millions))
summary_data2
```

* `summary_data1` includes the total number of deaths per year.
* `summary_data2` includes the number of deaths per cause per year.

## Exercise 1

Compare the number of rows (observations) and number of columns (variables) of:

* `mydata`, 
* `summary_data1`, and 
* `summary_data2` (in the Environment tab).

Notice that:
* `summary_data2` has exactly 3 times as many rows as `summary_data1`. Why?
* `mydata` has 5 variables, whereas the summarised tibbles have 2 and 3. Which variables got dropped? Why?


## Exercise 2

For each cause, calculate its percentage to total deaths in each year.

Hint: Use `full_join()` on `summary_data1` and `summary_data2`.

```{r}
# Exercise 2 - your R code:

```


# `mutate()`

Mutate works similarly to `summarise()` (as in it respects groupings set with `group_by()`), but it adds a new column into the original data. `summarise()`, on the other hand, condenses the data into a minimal table that only includes the variables specifically asked for.

## Exercise 3

Investigate these examples to learn how `summarise()` and `mutate()` differ.

```{r}
summarise_example = mydata %>% 
	summarise(total_deaths = sum(deaths_millions)) 
summarise_example

mutate_example = mydata %>% 
	mutate(total_deaths = sum(deaths_millions))
mutate_example
```

You should see that `mutate()` adds the same number total number (309.4174) to every line in the tibble. 

## Exercise 4 (optional)

Based on what we just observed on how `mutate()` adds a value to each row, can you think of a way to redo **Exercise 2** without using a join? 
Hint: instead of creating `summary_data1` (total deaths per year) as a separate tibble which we then join with `summary_data2` (total deaths for all causes per year), we can use `mutate()` to add total death per year to each row.

```{r}
# Exercise 4 - your R code:

```


# Wide vs long: `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()`

## Wide format
Although having data in the long format is very convenient for R, for publication tables, it makes sense to spread some of the values out into columns:

```{r}
alldata = full_join(summary_data1, summary_data2)

alldata %>%
  mutate(percentage = 100*total_per_cause/total_per_year) %>% 
	mutate(percentage = paste0(round(percentage, 2), "%")) %>% # round and add % label
	select(year, cause, percentage) %>% #only select vars you want in table
	pivot_wider(names_from = cause, values_from = percentage)
```

## Exercise 5
Calculate the percentage of male and female deaths for each year. Then use `pivot_wider()` to put the values into columns. This makes it more human-readable.

Hints:

* create `summary_data3` that includes a variable called `total_per_sex`
* join `summary_data1` and `summary_data3` into a new tibble
* calculate the percentage of `total_per_sex` to `total_per_year`
* round, add % labels (or use `percent()` by including `library(scales)`)
* then use `pivot_wider()`
* save your object as `result_wider`


Solution: 
```{r}
# Exercise 5 - your R code:

```

## Long format

The inverse of `pivot_wider()` is `pivot_longer()`. Be aware that making data longer is harder to get right at first. Don't be discouraged if `pivot_longer()` takes a few tries and tests. We find it harder to do as well.

The code here is the solution to Exercise 5 as we need something wider to be able to make it longer again:
```{r}
mydata %>% 
	group_by(year) %>% 
	summarise(total_per_year = sum(deaths_millions)) ->
	summary_data1

mydata %>% 
	group_by(year, sex) %>% 
	summarise(total_per_sex = sum(deaths_millions)) ->
	summary_data3

alldata = full_join(summary_data1, summary_data3)

result_wider = alldata %>% 
  mutate(percentage = round(100*total_per_sex/total_per_year, 0)) %>%
  mutate(percentage = paste0(percentage, "%")) %>% 
  select(year, sex, percentage) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = percentage)

result_wider
```

* After piping in the data, the next argument to `pivot_longer()` indicates which columns should be put together into the new longer variable. Since `result_wider` is a very small example tibble, we can just specify the column we don't want pulled together - `year`. In `pivot_longer()`, `-year` means we want to put everything but year into the new longer columns.

* We then add `names_to = "sex", values_to = "percentage"` to give the new columns names. These are quoted as they are new names we are assigning, feel free to experiment with changing "sex" or "percentage" to anything else here, even your name. It's just a new name you are choosing for the new columns. Whereas in the `pivot_wider()` example above, sex and percentage were not quoted, as they were referring to existing columns within the dataset, not new names we are assigning.

```{r}
# Exercise 6 - modify this:
result_wider %>% 
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = "sex", values_to = "percentage")
```

## Exercise 6

The arguments `names_to` and `values_to` are not strictly necessary, if you omit them the columns will get assigned defaults - "name" and "value". Delete the arguments `names_to = "sex", values_to = "percentage"` from the code below, so the function becomes `pivot_longer(-year)` to see convince yourself the previous sentence holds true.

```{r}
result_wider %>% 
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = "sex", values_to = "percentage")
```

### Selecting columns for pivot_longer, select helpers

If your tibble has many columns, you'll need to list the ones you do want to collect. For that, you will have to use a select helper. You can find the list of select helpers by typing "select helpers" into the Help tab in RStudio and then clicking on the page listed as "tidyselect::select_helpers		Select helpers". Alternatively, search online for examples. They can be extremely helpful and powerful.

How we usually get started with a new `pivot_longer()` line is that we figure out the select helper for it first by trialling it inside `select()`.

For example, the previous example would be this first:

```{r}
result_wider %>% 
  select(-year)
```

This shows us the columns that `pivot_longer()` will work on.

Let's figure out which select helper will get us the two columns: Male and Female. If we were just using `select()` and not intending to change it to `pivot_longer()`, we can of course just do:

```{r}
result_wider %>% 
  select(Female, Male)
```

But `pivot_longer()` will require the specification in a single argument, whereas that comma between them makes them two arguments. We can tie them into a single argument using `c()`:

```{r}
result_wider %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(Female, Male))
```

Or if you had many more than just 2 columns to be combined, you should use a select helper. They don't make a lot of sense with this very simple example, but have a look at the select helpers examples in the Help tab and see how these could translate to the data you are dealing with. For example, if the columns you want to combine all start with the same prefix, use `starts_with()`. If you are familiar with regular expressions, use `matches()`, etc.

One final select or pivot_longer() tip to show here is the use of the semicolon. This selects all columns `from:to`.

```{r}
# a new example tibble:
tibble(x1 = "one", x2 = "more", x3 = "cool", x4 = "example", x5 = "this", x6 = "is")
```

Selecting columns from `x3` to `x6`:

```{r}
tibble(x1 = "one", x2 = "more", x3 = "cool", x4 = "example", x5 = "this", x6 = "is") %>% 
  select(x3:x6)
```

# Sorting: `arrange()`

To reorder data ascendingly or descendingly, use `arrange()`:

```{r}
mydata %>% 
	group_by(year) %>% 
	summarise(total = sum(deaths_millions))  %>%
	arrange(-year) # reorder after summarise()
```


## Exercise 7

This exercise includes multiple steps, combining all of the above.

* Load `"global_burden_disease_long.rda"`.
* Calculate the total number of deaths in Developed and Developing countries. Hint: use `group_by(location)` and `summarise( Include new column name = sum() here)`.
* Calculate the total number of deaths in Developed and Developing countries and for men and women. Hint: this is as easy as adding `, sex` to `group_by()`.
* Filter for 1990.
* `pivot_wider()` using `location` column as `names_from` and and your new calculated column as `values_from.`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
load(here::here("global_burden_disease_long.rda"))

# Exercise 7 - your R code:

```

## Export object or table as a spreadsheet. 

To save as a csv file use `write_csv()`:

```{r warning=FALSE}
write_csv(result_wider, "gbd_genders_summarised.csv")
```

You can open a csv file with Excel and copy the table into Word or PowerPoint for presenting.
